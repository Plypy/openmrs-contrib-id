OpenMRS ID Quick Setup
======================

Hello, and thanks for hacking on OpenMRS ID!

Please run the following command in the console at the bottom of your screen
to finish setting up your Nitrous environment:

    bash ./workspace/openmrs-contrib-id/nitrous/bootstrap.sh
    
Once completed, you can start and stop OpenMRS by changing directory to
`~/workspace/openmrs-contrib-id` and running

    node app/app
    
Use the Preview menu -> Port 3000 to access the Dashboard. Press CTRL-C in your
console to shut down the Dashboard.
