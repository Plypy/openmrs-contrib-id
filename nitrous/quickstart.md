OpenMRS ID Quick Setup
======================

Hello, and thanks for hacking on OpenMRS ID!

Please run the following command in the console at the bottom of your screen
to finish setting up your Nitrous environment:

    bash ./workspace/openmrs-contrib-id/nitrous/bootstrap.sh
    
Once completed, you can start and stop OpenMRS by changing to the
`~/workspace/openmrs-contrib-id` directory and running

    node app/app
    
Use the Preview menu -> Port 3000 to access the Dashboard. Press CTRL-C in your
console to shut down the Dashboard.

If you restart your Nitrous box, run the following commands to start up the
services OpenMRS ID depends on:

    parts start openldap
    parts start mongodb
    mailcatcher --http-ip 0.0.0.0 --http-port 4000
