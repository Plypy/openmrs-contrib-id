OpenMRS ID Quick Setup
======================

Hello, and thanks for hacking on OpenMRS ID!

Your environment on Nitrous.IO is nearly ready, but you need to install
a few dependencies and download some demo data.

Please run the following command in the console at the bottom of your screen:

    ./workspace/openmrs-contrib-id/nitrous/bootstrap.sh
