    <p>We're glad you joined us! First, you should start making connections in the community by letting others know who you are on <a href='http://talk.openmrs.org'>OpenMRS Talk</a></p>
    a.btn.btn-success(href='http://talk.openmrs.org') Start making connections

  h3 After that, here are some other places you can use your OpenMRS ID:
  br
  ol(type='disc')
    <li><a href='http://modules.openmrs.org'>Modules: </a> Extend OpenMRS in limitless ways, share your contributions.</li>
    <li><a href='https://wiki.openmrs.org/users/editmyprofile.action'>Wiki: </a>Create your own personal space, and your profile.</li>
    <li><a href='http://talk.openmrs.org'>Talk: </a> This is the primary communication medium for the OpenMRS community.</li>
    <li><a href='https://issues.openmrs.org'>Issues: </a> Report bugs, Suggest Improvements, Find a way to contribute!</li>

  // <p>Don't regard the ID Dashboard as pass√© just yet! As the OpenMRS Community moves forward, you'll be able to control more and more of your Community Profile from here. Until then, why not <a href='#' class='highlight-banners'>head over to another Community Application?</a></p>
